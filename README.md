# CARLA-based Autonomous Driving Perception & ADAS

This repository contains a Computer Vision and ADAS pipeline
for autonomous driving using the CARLA simulator.

## Focus Areas
- Synthetic data generation using CARLA
- Vision-based object detection (YOLOv8)
- ADAS scenarios (pedestrian crossing, bus stop)
- End-to-end perception-to-control pipeline

## Tech Stack
- Python
- CARLA Simulator (0.9.15)
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV

## Implemented Scenarios
- Pedestrian zebra crossing with automatic speed control
- Bicycle detection using synthetic data
- Bus stop scenario for data generation

## Project Structure
See directory layout for perception, ADAS, and simulation modules.

## Goal
This project is designed as preparation for a Master’s thesis
in autonomous driving and computer vision.
