## Relevance to Master’s Thesis

This project demonstrates:

- Autonomous decision-making in structured environments
- Multi-agent coordination using rule-based logic
- Simulation-based development using CARLA
- Foundations for vision-based bus stop detection

The project can be extended with:
- Camera-based signboard detection (YOLO / CNN)
- Sensor fusion (camera + map)
- Real-to-sim transfer learning
- Evaluation of simulated vs real-world perception
